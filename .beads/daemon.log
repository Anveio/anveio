  2. Git remote URL changed (run 'bd migrate --update-repo-id')
  3. Database corruption
  4. bd was upgraded and URL canonicalization changed

Solutions:
  - If remote URL changed: bd migrate --update-repo-id
  - If bd was upgraded: bd migrate --update-repo-id
  - If wrong database: rm -rf .beads && bd init
